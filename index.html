                <h2>Hi i'm Rick Sanchez </h2>
                    <p>     
                        Rick is a tall, lanky old man. He has long legs and arms, and is very skinny. He  has a dimly tanned ashy complexion and grey-blue hair with a bald spot on the back of his head. He has spiky blue hair on his head and a unibrow. His face is wrinkly as he has bags under his eyelids and a pressure fold above his unibrow that follows its position and laugh lines on both sides of his mouth. He wears a white lab coat with a light blue undershirt underneath it. He also wears brown pants, a dark brown belt with a yellow buckle, and black shoes. He is occasionally seen with some green spill on his mouth, showing up mainly when he is drunk, or during a rare chance where he throws up. Rick speaks in a rambling, stammering manner that is often interrupted by belching and gagging, usually from being drunk.

                    <p> In the episode A Rickle in Time, Rick froze time for the equivalent of six months which caused time to start splitting and dividing multiple times, to the point where a Fourth Dimensional Being from the Galactic Federation came and tried to arrest him </p>

                    <p> In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", Rick broke out of the Galactic Federation Prison, killed many of the guards, and finally, blew the entire place up, which in turn, must have freed any other prisoners, assuming any survived the explosion.</p>
